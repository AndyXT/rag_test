Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development

This book will teach you to write fast and safe systems programming code in Rust.
Rust is a systems programming language that combines the performance and control 
of languages like C and C++ with the memory safety of languages like Java and Python.

Key concepts covered:
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Ownership and borrowing
- Pattern matching
- Functional programming features
- Concurrent programming

--- Page 2 ---
Chapter 1: Introduction to Rust

Rust was originally developed by Mozilla Research as a language for building
the Firefox browser engine. It has since grown into a general-purpose systems
programming language used for operating systems, web servers, databases,
and many other applications.

The Rust compiler enforces memory safety at compile time, preventing common
bugs like null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races.

--- Page 3 ---
Memory Management in Rust

Traditional systems languages like C and C++ give programmers direct control
over memory allocation and deallocation. This power comes with responsibility:
programmers must ensure that memory is properly managed to avoid bugs.

Rust introduces the concept of ownership to solve this problem. Every value
in Rust has a variable that's called its owner. There can only be one owner
at a time. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

function example() {{
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s owns the string
    // s goes out of scope here and the memory is freed
}}

--- Page 4 ---
Borrowing and References

Instead of transferring ownership, Rust allows you to create references to values.
This is called borrowing. References allow you to use a value without taking
ownership of it.

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {{
    s.len()
}}

fn main() {{
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1);
    println!("The length of '{{}}' is {{}}.", s1, len);
}}
